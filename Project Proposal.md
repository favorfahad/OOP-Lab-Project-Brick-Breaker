# OOP-Lab-Project-Brick-Breaker
This repository is for our university's second semester project, and to get our ease in the process of evaluating the code of it.
# Project Proposal:
## Name: Brick Breaker
We are planning to create a decent brick breaker game that includes GUI and UI integration. The players will get points on hitting each brick correctly, and can also fail the level under certain circumstances. The ball will also start to accelerate as the points will increase.
