1. Executive Summary
Overview:
This project aimed to recreate a classic arcade game—Brick Breaker—using the C++ programming language. It explored object-oriented programming (OOP) principles through the implementation of game logic, graphics, and audio using SFML. The project was built in Visual Studio and structured into three main parts: building mechanics, designing with visual assets, and refining with audio and power-ups.
Key Findings:
The team successfully developed a playable game that includes key OOP-based functionalities like modular class structures and sprite interactions. The addition of a theme song and power-ups made the game interactive and engaging. Testing revealed strong positive feedback from peers, validating the game’s usability and entertainment value.

2. Introduction
Background:
This project was inspired by the desire to understand game mechanics through a hands-on approach using C++. The classic Brick Breaker game provides a simple yet effective model to implement real-time object interaction and event-driven programming, both of which are key aspects of OOP.
Project Objectives:
•	Recreate Brick Breaker with C++ using object-oriented design.
•	Apply visual and audio elements through SFML.
•	Provide a working, fun, and functional game that users can play and enjoy.

3. Project Description
Scope:
Inclusions:
•	Game paddle and ball mechanics.
•	Brick setup with collision detection.
•	Power-up features and background music.
•	User interface including a start menu.
Exclusions:
•	No multiple levels or advanced AI.
•	No multiplayer or online integration.
Technical Overview:
The project was developed in Microsoft Visual Studio and VS Code, using the SFML library for graphics and audio. C++ was used to handle all the core logic, game structure, and class-based interactions.

4. Methodology
Approach:
A simple and collaborative approach was adopted. The project was completed in phases, and tasks were distributed based on individual strengths. Regular discussions and mini-review sessions helped resolve issues and maintain progress.
Roles and Responsibilities:
•	Fahad Qureshi: Handled core game mechanics—ball movement, collisions, and paddle interactions.
•	Muhammad Saim: Designed the UI using SFML, including sprites for bricks, paddle, and ball, as well as the start menu.
•	Bilal Khan: Collaborated on both mechanics and design; integrated background music and power-ups, and polished the menu layout.

5. Project Implementation
Design and Structure:
The interface followed a retro-funky theme with a splash of blue and creative fonts. The layout included a menu screen, the gameplay area with bricks and paddle, and power-up visuals.

Functionalities Developed:
•	Paddle movement via keyboard input
•	Ball reflection and collision with paddle and bricks
•	Brick removal on impact
•	Score tracking and game-over conditions
•	Power-ups with effects
•	Theme music integration
Challenges Faced:
One major challenge was transitioning to SFML, as it was the team's first time using this library. Learning curve issues were tackled with online resources and peer support.

6. Results
Project Outcomes:
The game met its goals—players can enjoy a complete game loop with responsive controls, sound effects, and feedback through power-ups. All core mechanics were implemented and functioned smoothly.
Screenshots and Illustrations:
 
 
Testing and Validation:
Testing was conducted informally by allowing fellow students to play the game. Their feedback helped in refining the UI and balancing game difficulty. The feedback was largely positive and indicated that the game was fun and intuitive.

7. Conclusion
Summary of Findings:
This project achieved its goal of replicating a simple yet engaging Brick Breaker game while applying key OOP concepts. The use of SFML expanded our development toolkit and opened up creative possibilities.
Final Remarks:
The experience was highly rewarding and educational. While the game was simple, it demonstrated the potential of C++ and SFML for game development. We hope to improve and expand on this in future projects, possibly with level progression or multiplayer features.
